# Consulting Foo

Status:  Work in Progress (2021-05-08)

A collection of a few tips I have learned while working with some very smart folks over the years...  If my [Manifesto.md](./Manifesto.md) is the strategery, this is more of the tactical.

## Day to Day
* 
* Organize
* Timebox
* Communicate
* Take Notes (and... review notes)
* Feedback Loop (is all of this working?  What can be improved?)

## Situational Response

### Crisis
* if this is a "crisis response" type of scenario, be sure to provide initial status to stakeholders, and set the expectation of when they should receive the next update.
* timebox yourself to a particular problem (leave time to work on the problem, but if you're not making progress after a certain amount of time, move on)
* rely on ALL available resources to solve problems  
* know when to escalate (if that is part of the exercise)

### 
Check in with folks - Sometimes they may be stuck/frustrated but not want to feel as though they are burdening others.  
Repeat back to them what you believe you heard, and ask for confirmation.
Acknowledge contributions from others.
Encourage others to... encourage others.
Pay it forward.
